# Smoothing Based Optimization

A bunch of scripts to play with smoothing-based optimization techniques.

Currently includes the following files:
* `main.py` -- used to launch numerical optimization
* `main_tf.py` -- used to launch network training (very slow)
* `smoothing_based_optimization.py` -- contains the basic smoothing optimization algorithm
