# Smoothing Based Optimization

A bunch of scripts to play with smoothing-based optimization techniques.

Currently includes the following files:
* `main.py` -- use to launch numerical optimization
* `main_tf.py` -- use to launch network training (very slow)
* `benchmark_algorithms.py` -- compare optimization algoritms on series of tests
* `dgs.py` -- define Directional Gaussian Smoothing algorithm
* `bfgs_dgs.py` -- define BFGS+DGS algorithm
* `sbfgs.py` -- define Smoothed BFGS (it doesn't really work though)
* `smoothing_visualization.py` -- create interactive smoothing plot
